Hello!

I am ([UNICEFâ€™s first Chief Statistician](https://www.unicef.org/media/experts/joao-pedro-azevedo)), appointed in February 2023 at UNICEF Headquarters to lead the organizationâ€™s global data and statistical work. Before joining UNICEF, I worked for 16 years at the World Bank, as Lead Economist of the Poverty and Equity Practice and Education Global Practice, where I had several roles such as EdTech Fellow, Education Statistics Coordinator, and Global Lead, co-leading the Global Solution Group on Welfare Measurement and Statistical Capacity for Results, as well as the Data for Goals agenda. Before my tenure at the World Bank, I served as the superintendent of Monitoring and Evaluation at the Secretary of Finance for the State of Rio de Janeiro, as well as a research fellow at the Institute of Applied Economic Research from the Brazilian Ministry of Planning (IPEA) in Rio de Janeiro.
